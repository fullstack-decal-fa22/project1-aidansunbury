                    <h3>Berkeley Codify</h3>
                    <p>This semester, I founded a software development club to work on both internal and client projects. In addition to organizing and managing the club as president, I am leading a team to build a mobile app for Chabot Space and Science Center. Berkeley Codify is also working on building a website for the Punjabi Art Collective and an internal project that creates data visualizations using the Spotify API. </p>
                    <h3>Chabot Space and Science Center</h3>
                    <p>I worked as an intern at Chabot Space and Science Center for two years. There, I was responsible for managing science demonstrations on the museum floor and working on special project teams. Team projects included building solar powered generators, creating an educational video series using Scratch, and creating an engineering design challenge. I led the teams responsible for creating the videos below.</p>

                    <h3>Private Tutor</h3>
                    <p>I worked as a private tutor teaching high school math and chemistry. I was self employed, so in addition to teaching, I learned how to market myself, negotiate terms, and manage client relationships.</p>

                    <h3>Mountain Biking</h3>
                    <p>After running around the trails near my house for years on the cross country team, I eventually got into mountain biking on those same trails. Mountain biking is much cheaper than my other outdoor hobby of skiing, and you can do it almost anywhere year round.</p>
                    <h3>Camping</h3>
                    <p>I love camping and backpacking because it is like being a tourist, except in nature. Everyone has a travel bucket list, but mine is mostly filled with places in the outdoors I want to venture to. I would love to hike to the top of Mt. Whitney, camp in the Grand Canyon, and backpack through Yosemite. </p>
                    <h3>Politics and Debate</h3>
                    <p>While I am not too versed on national politics. I love getting involved in local issues. Things like city planing often go unnoticed by most people. I initially got into this by competing in parlimentary debate during high school.</p>
